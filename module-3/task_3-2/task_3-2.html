      <li>[1. In part 1, is it possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop?]</li>
      <p>[Yes, it is possible]</p>
      <li>[In part 2, can we create what is known as an "infinite" loop within the condition of the "while" loop?
          Describe what would or would not be necessary to achieve this. Provide a thorough explanation of
          your answer.]</li>
      <p>[no it is not possible to create an infinite loop within the condition of the "while" loop alone. 
        An infinite loop requires the condition to always evaluate to true, 
        which means the condition itself must be designed to never become false.
        This typically involves using a constant true condition like "while(true)" 
        and controlling the loop exit with a break statement inside the loop body.]</p>
      <li>[Discuss briefly how quickly or slowly a computer might be able to compute this, considering the
          number of guesses and the time it takes. How does the program behave while it is guessing? Can
          the program perform other tasks concurrently?]</li>
      <p>[A computer can make these guesses very quickly, often in milliseconds. 
        While the program is guessing, it is usually busy with that task and doesnt do other things 
        at the same time. It can only perform other tasks concurrently if it is specifically 
        designed to use asynchronous code, multi-threading, or multiple processes.]</p>
      <li>[Explain the relationship between rows and columns in nested "for" loops. Can we, for instance,
          change the order, considering rows to be innermost or columns to be innermost, or does this not
          matter?]</li>
      <p>[The order of nested "for" loops affects the sequence in which rows and columns are processed. 
        Normally, the outer loop represents rows and the inner loop represents columns, 
        but this can be reversed depending on the desired output. Changing the order changes the way the pattern moves, 
        so it does matter depending on the context and what you want to achieve.]</p>

      <li>What is an array? A short and concise answer is expected here!</li>
      <p>An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, typically of the same type, in a sequential manner.</p>
      <li>What does it mean to "hardcode" when we talk about programming? (In English, it's called "hard
      coding", "hard-coding", or "hardcoding").</li>
      <p>To hardcode means to write values directly into the source code rather than allowing them to be changed 
        at runtime or read from an external source.</p>
      <li>Explain in plain text what happens in task 3, and how we can traverse (iterate) the array when we
      (humans) don't "know" how long the array is.</li>
      <p>In task 3, we iterate through an array using a loop. We can traverse the array without knowing its length 
        by using methods like `for...of` or checking `array.length` in a loop condition.</p>
      <li>Why is it beneficial to store instances of a class in arrays, as in task 4?</li>
      <p>Storing instances of a class in arrays allows us to manage multiple objects efficiently and perform operations 
        on all instances collectively.</p>
      <li>Try your best to explain the EWeekDays object from task 7. How do we use the "value" attribute, for
      example? In what way do "WeekDay", "Workdays", and "Weekends" differ from each other? If we
      wanted to create a new element "WorkoutDays", which would contain "Monday", "Wednesday", and
      "Thursday", how would it ideally look? (I will choose the best answer to this task and reward it with
      pizza in the cafeteria right after New Year. Remember to mark in your submission if you want to
      participate in the competition!)</li>
      <p>The EWeekDays object is an enumeration that defines different categories of days. The "value" attribute is 
        used to assign numeric values to each day category. "WeekDay" includes all weekdays, while "Workdays" and "Weekends" are subsets 
        of weekdays and weekends respectively.
      <li> In task 8, we will use a "callback" routine when sorting. Explain how such a "callback" routine works.</li>
      <p>A callback routine is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after a certain 
        event or condition is met. In sorting, the callback function defines the criteria for comparing elements.</p> 
      <li>What happens in the sorting routines you have created? Try to explain how the array can figure out
      if an element should come before or after another. The best way to answer this is to actually print
      both parameters each time the sorting routine runs.
      <li>In task 10, we will create an array with rows and columns. Explain what the first element of the array
      contains.</li>
      <p>The first element of a two-dimensional array typically contains another array, which represents the first 
        row of the matrix or grid.</p>

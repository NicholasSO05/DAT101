      <li>Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?</li>
        <p>[Object-oriented development is important because it promotes code reusability, modularity, and maintainability. 
          It allows developers to model real-world entities and their interactions, making it easier to manage complex 
          software systems.]</p>
      <li>In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and how 
        this type of object can help us in software development.</li>
        <p>[The AccountType static object is used to define constants or predefined values for different account types 
          (e.g., savings, checking). This helps in maintaining consistency and reducing errors by providing a centralized place for these definitions.]</p>
      <li>Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class? Explain how we can 
        create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.</li>
        <p>[Encapsulation is used to protect internal data and implementation details of a class, improving data 
          integrity and reducing unintended side effects. We “hide” code to prevent external code from directly 
          modifying internal state. In JavaScript, public members are created by assigning properties to this, 
          while private members can be created with closures]</p>
      <li>Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript.</li>
        <p>[When new is used, we create a new object, set its prototype to the constructor 
          functions prototype, binds this to the new object, executes the constructor code, and returns the new 
          object.]</p>

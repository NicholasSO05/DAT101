      <li>Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?</li>
        <p>[Object-oriented development is important because it promotes code reusability, modularity, and maintainability. 
          It allows developers to model real-world entities and their interactions, making it easier to manage complex 
          software systems.]</p>
      <li>In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and how 
        this type of object can help us in software development.</li>
        <p>[The AccountType static object is used to define constants or predefined values for different account types 
          (e.g., savings, checking). This helps in maintaining consistency and reducing errors by providing a centralized place for these definitions.]</p>
      <li>Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class? Explain how we can 
        create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.</li>
        <p>[Encapsulation hides internal implementation details from users of the class, promoting data integrity and security. 
          Private members are inaccessible from outside the class, while public members are accessible. In JavaScript constructor functions, 
          private members can be created using closures or symbols.]</p>
      <li>Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript.</li>
        <p>[When the "new" command is used with a constructor function, it creates a new instance of that function's prototype. 
          It initializes the new object with properties defined within the constructor function and sets up its prototype chain correctly.]</p>
